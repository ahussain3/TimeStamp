# TimeStamp

TimeStamp is an app I built in the summer of 2012. It is a tool for time management. It helps you easily track where you spend your time. It is synced up with GCal / iCal so you don't need to disrupt your ordinary workflow in order to use it.

The idea for the app came about after a exercise I had been doing tracking exactly where I spent my time. After 18 months of tracking my time using iCal I had a dataset which looked like this:

# The app
The app then, was a way to make this data-logging process easier. Here is what the core UI looks like:

The GIF above shows how you can (all changes synced automatically with your iPhone's calendar):
- create a new event
- modifying an existing event
- delete an event
- shows off data entry without needing to type out the name of the event (much faster than using the Calendar app).


We also had some interesting data reporting features:

The app was approved to the the app store but we eventually had to retutn to university and were unable to keep up with updating it for new versions of iOS, so the project has since died. Nevertheless it was great fun to work on and taught me a lot about programming in Objective-C and Cocoa.
